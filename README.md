## Parallel Programming MonteCarlo Simulation Comparison -- CPU vs GPU Performance
---

Frameworks:

- CPU Parallelism - OpenMP

- GPU Parallelism - CUDA
---

The basic Monte Carlo scenario:

*A person waiting with a snowball waits until a truck passes by and throws the snowball when they are even with eachother.*
*The origin for this coordinate system is at the kid's feet. The X direction goes to the right. The Y directiomn goes deeper into the scene.*
*We are assuming that the only thing that matters are the horizontal positions of the truck and the snowball.*


*Note: This is a project conducted in the course CS 475 - Parallel Programming at at Oregon State University*
